# Pewlett Hackard Employee Database Research Project

***Welcome to the Pewlett Hackard Employee Database Research Project!***

This project is focused on researching and analyzing the data of employees who worked at Pewlett Hackard during the 1980s and 1990s.
The data for this research project is available in the form of six CSV files as folowing:

***departments.csv ,dept_emp.csv ,dept_manager.csv , employees.csv , salaries.csv , and titles.csv*** 

The goal of this project is to design the tables to hold the data from the CSV files, import the CSV files into a SQL database, and then answer various questions about the data.

## Project Overview

This project is divided into three parts:

1- Data Modeling

2- Data Engineering

3- Data Analysis

## ***1- Data Modeling***

The first step of the project is to inspect the CSV files and create an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) of the tables using Quick Database Diagrams.
This will help to understand the relationships between the different tables and design the schema for the tables.

## ***2- Data Engineering***

In this step, i created a table schema for each of the six CSV files, and specify the data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints to ensure the data integrity and relationships between the tables.

## ***3- Data Analysis***

In the final step of the project, answered various questions about the data. Some of the questions are:

1- List the employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary of each employee.

2- List the first name, last name, and hire date for the employees who were hired in 1986.

3- List the manager of each department along with their department number, department name, employee number, last name, and first name.

4- List the department number for each employee along with that employeeâ€™s employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

5- List first name, last name, and sex of each employee whose first name is Hercules and whose last name begins with the letter B.

6- List each employee in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, and first name.

7- List each employee in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

8- List the frequency counts, in descending order, of all the employee last names (that is, how many employees share each last name).

## Requirements

SQL database

SQL client such as PgAdmin

Knowledge of SQL and data modeling concepts

## Conclusion

This project helped me to gain hands-on experience in data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis.
By the end of this project,i will solid understanding of how to import data from CSV files into a SQL database and perform various analysis on the data.
